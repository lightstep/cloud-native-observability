# The Why and What of Cloud-Native

Software touches nearly every aspect of our lives and has rewritten the playing
field in nearly every industry. The fact that software is _strategic_ is firmly
"not news." That software deserves _massive levels of investment_ isn't news,
either.

What's less clear is _how_ to successfully turn these massive investments into
innovating and reliable software applications: it's easy enough to hire a few
thousand developers, but how do we get thousands of developers to collaborate
efficiently on a single piece of deployable software?

Here's the thing: we don't! Instead, **to make software development scale, we
split these massive, strategic software applications into pieces – aka,
"microservices" – and use cloud-native devops practices and cloud-native
technology stacks to develop, deploy, and operate them.** At the same time, we
want to get out of the business of procuring, maintaining, or even _thinking_
about hardware, so all of the above happens in hosted infrastructure run by
multiple cloud vendors.

## So what is "Cloud-Native" exactly?

Cloud-native software is not the same thing as "production software that's
hosted by a public cloud provider" – cloud-native software is characterized by
software architecture and development practices that can scale linearly, even
with thousands of developers or billions of end-users.

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation defines Cloud-Native Technology [as
follows](https://glossary.cncf.io/cloud_native_tech/#what-it-is):

> Cloud native technologies, also referred to as the cloud native stack, are
> the technologies used to build cloud native applications. These technologies
> enable organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern and
> dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds, while
> leveraging cloud computing benefits to their fullest. They are designed from
> the ground up to exploit the capabilities of cloud computing and containers,
> service meshes, microservices, and immutable infrastructure exemplify this
> approach.

Ironically, some cloud-native apps don't even run in the cloud! A
kubernetes-based app with hundreds of microservices running on premises is more
"cloud-native" than a lift-and-shift Oracle business application running in
AWS.

## Why Cloud-Native Matters

Does this approach actually increase release velocity? Yes, and sometimes by
factors of
[more than 100x](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/microservices-financial-times/).
If software requires money and time, cloud-native can act as a force multiplier
to one, or both, of these inputs. We can leverage the implicit expertise of
other developers and engineers who build these platforms, granting us greater
reliability. Our money is more flexible, as we don't have to invest upfront
capital in the care and feeding of servers to run our programs.

This benefit is so large that it extends across architectures -- analyst reports
find [cloud ROI to be over 4x
self-hosted](https://nucleusresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/u176-Cloud-delivers-4.01-times-the-ROI-as-on-premises.pdf),
which is pretty amazing all on its own. Beyond the simple math, cloud-native
software bridges a solutions gap as well, giving you the means to leverage
expertise in _many_ fields to enhance what you can build. Need some
text-to-speech? There's managed cloud services for that. Want to know what's
going on with your software in production? A constellation of open source and
software as a service tools are out there for your perusal.

Beyond the economic arguments, though, cloud-native paints a wonderfully
collaborative picture of how software can benefit our lives and world. The
consolidation of data centers has created a [green
revolution](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/27/technology/cloud-computing-energy-usage.html),
where computing power has gone up but energy use has gone down. Open source
software, once regarded as a land of free-speech absolutists and cranks, has
been commercialized and funded by the world's largest companies to build even
more cloud-native software, freely given to the next generation of developers
to solve the challenges of today and tomorrow. The adaptive capacity and
scaling benefits of the cloud were on display in full effect as a global
workforce moved from offices to work-from-home, and
[Zoom](https://www.zoom.com) became the lifeline for our personal and
professional lives. It's hard to imagine the future without the cloud, but it's
even harder to imagine the present.
