# The Why and What of Cloud-Native

Software touches nearly every aspect of our lives and has rewritten the playing
field in nearly every industry. The fact that software is _strategic_ is firmly
"not news." That software deserves _massive levels of investment_ isn't news,
either.

What's less clear is _how_ to successfully turn these massive investments into
innovating and reliable software applications: it's easy enough to hire a few
thousand developers, but how do we get thousands of developers to collaborate
efficiently on a single piece of deployable software?

Here's the thing: we don't! Instead, we split these massive, strategic software
applications into pieces – aka, "microservices" – and use cloud-native DevOps
practices and cloud-native technology stacks to develop, deploy, and operate
them. At the same time, we want to get out of the business of procuring,
maintaining, or even _thinking_ about hardware, so all of the above happens in
hosted infrastructure run by multiple cloud vendors.

## What Is Cloud-Native?

The cloud represents a fundamental shift in computing. In the same way that
public utilities revolutionized the production of goods and services, the cloud
provides on-demand resources to individuals and organizations around
the world. This approach removes barriers to innovation and feature delivery not
only for development teams but for an entire organization.

More than simply 'servers on demand', the cloud is defined by its elastic nature
and programmatic access. This elasticity allows us to trade capital expenditures
for operational ones, and this programmability allows us to scale far greater
than we would be otherwise able to. However, we cannot fully realize the
potential of this new computing paradigm while continuing to architect our
applications and organizations by the status quo. This where cloud-native comes
into play.

Cloud-native, or cloud-native software, is a particular architectural pattern
that makes use of the unique characteristics of the cloud in order to accelerate
innovation, increase reliability, and optimize performance. Cloud-native
applications are designed to take advantage of the scalable and distributed
nature of the cloud.

## Why Cloud-Native Matters

Does this approach actually increase release velocity? Yes, and sometimes by
factors of
[more than 100x](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/microservices-financial-times/).
If software requires money and time, cloud-native can act as a force multiplier
to one, or both, of these inputs. We can leverage the implicit expertise of
other developers and engineers who build these platforms, granting us greater
reliability. Our money is more flexible, as we don't have to invest upfront
capital in the care and feeding of servers to run our programs.

This benefit is so large that it extends across architectures -- analyst reports
find [cloud ROI to be over 4x
self-hosted](https://nucleusresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/u176-Cloud-delivers-4.01-times-the-ROI-as-on-premises.pdf),
which is pretty amazing all on its own. Beyond the simple math, cloud-native
software bridges a solutions gap as well, giving you the means to leverage
expertise in _many_ fields to enhance what you can build. Need some
text-to-speech? There's managed cloud services for that. Want to know what's
going on with your software in production? A constellation of open source and
software as a service tools are out there for your perusal.

Beyond the economic arguments, though, cloud-native paints a wonderfully
collaborative picture of how software can benefit our lives and world. The
consolidation of data centers has created a [green
revolution](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/27/technology/cloud-computing-energy-usage.html),
where computing power has gone up but energy use has gone down. Open source
software, once regarded as a land of free-speech absolutists and cranks, has
been commercialized and funded by the world's largest companies to build even
more [cloud-native software](https://www.cncf.io), freely given to the next
generation of developers to solve the challenges of today and tomorrow. The
adaptive capacity and scaling benefits of the cloud were on display in full
effect as a global workforce moved from offices to work-from-home, and
[Zoom](https://www.zoom.com) became the lifeline for our personal and
professional lives. It's hard to imagine the future without the cloud, but it's
even harder to imagine the present.
