# Your Stories

To relate this project to real-world examples, we're asking _you_ to tell us how
observability has shaped and impacted your organization or team. Are you
adopting cloud-native observability practices? What's gone well, and what
hasn't? What are your hopes for the future of observability, and what do you
wish you knew when you started?

If you'd like to share your story, please submit a pull request with a new file
in this folder. You don't need to write a book, a couple of paragraphs is fine.
Your stories may be incorporated into future revisions of this project!
